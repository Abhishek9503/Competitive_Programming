# Competitive Programming Repository

Welcome to the Competitive Programming repository for the GDSC (Google Developer Student Clubs) club! This repository is designed to help students learn and improve their competitive programming skills, providing a collection of algorithms, data structures, templates, and problem-solving resources.

## Table of Contents

1. [Algorithms](#algorithms)
2. [Data Structures](#data-structures)
3. [Competitive Programming Templates](#competitive-programming-templates)
4. [Other Directories](#other-directories)
5. [How to Contribute](#how-to-contribute)
6. [Community Guidelines](#community-guidelines)

## Algorithms

The "Algorithms" directory contains a collection of well-documented algorithms implemented in various programming languages, including C++, Python, Java, and more. Each algorithm is accompanied by a README file that explains its purpose, usage, and provides links to relevant problems and resources for further learning.

## Data Structures

The "Data Structures" directory provides implementations of fundamental data structures. Explore this section to learn about data structures like arrays, linked lists, trees, and more. Each data structure includes C++ code and explanatory README files.

## Competitive Programming Templates

The "CP Templates" directory houses templates for common competitive programming tasks. These templates can be handy during coding competitions, saving you time on writing boilerplate code.

## Other Directories

Apart from algorithms, data structures, and templates, this repository also contains additional directories for various purposes. You may find directories for specific coding contests, practice problems, educational resources, and more.
